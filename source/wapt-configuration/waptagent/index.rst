Building the WAPT agent installer
=================================

Choosing the mode to uniquely identify the WAPT agents
------------------------------------------------------

In WAPT you can choose the unique identification mode of the agents.

When a WAPT agent registers the server must know if it is a new machine
or if it is a machine already registered.

For this, the WAPT server looks at the unique number "UUID" in the inventory.

WAPT offers 3 modes of operation to help you distinguish between hosts,
it is up to you to choose the mode that best suits you.

.. attention::

  After choosing a mode of operation it is difficult to change it,
  think carefully!

Identifying the WAPT agents by their BIOS UUID (serial number)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This mode of operation makes it possible to identify the machines
in the console in a physical manner.

If you replace a computer and give the new computer the same name
as the previous one, you will have two computers that will appear
in the WAPT console since you will have physically two different computers.

.. note::

   Some vendors do inadequate work and assign the same BIOS UUIDs to entire batches
   of computers. In this case, WAPT will only see one computer ...

Identifying the WAPT agent by host name
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This mode of operation is similar to that in Active Directory.
The machines are identified by their hostname.

.. note::

   This mode does not work if several machines in your fleet
   share the same name. We all know it should not happen!!

Identifying the WAPT agents with a randomly generated UUID
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This mode of operation allows PCs to be identified by their WAPT installation.
Each installation of WAPT generates a unique random number.
If you uninstall WAPT and then reinstall it,
you will see a new pc appear in your console.

Building the WAPT agent installer
---------------------------------

The :program:`waptagent` binary is an InnoSetup installer.

Once the WAPT console has been installed on the :term:`Administrator` computer,
we have all files required to build the WAPT agent installer.

* files that will be used during building of the WAPT agent are located
  in :file:`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\wapt`;

* installer source files (:file:`.iss` files) are located
  in :file:`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\wapt\\waptsetup`;

.. hint::

  Before building the WAPT agent, please verify the public certificate(s)
  in :file:`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\wapt\\ssl`.

  If you wish to deploy other public certificates on your :term:`Organization`'s
  computers that are equipped with WAPT, you will have
  to copy them in that folder.

.. danger::

  **DO NOT COPY the private key** of any :term:`Administrator`
  in :file:`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\wapt`.

  This folder is used when building the WAPT agent and the private keys
  would then be deployed on all the computers.

* In the WAPT console, go to :menuselection:`Tools --> Build the WAPT agent`.

* fill in the informations that are necessary for the installer:

  * the field :guilabel:`Public certificate`: **required**;

    example : :file:`C:\\private\\mydomain.crt`

  * the field :guilabel:`Address of the WAPT repository`: **required**;

    example : https://srvwapt.mydomain.lan/wapt

  * the field :guilabel:`Address of the WAPT Server`: **required**;

    example : https://srvwapt.mydomain.lan

  * the checkbox :guilabel:`Verify the WAPT Server HTTPS certificate`;

  * the field :guilabel:`Path to the bundle of certificates` to verify
    the HTTPS certificate of the WAPT Server;

  * the checkbox :guilabel:`Use Kerberos for registering WAPT agents`;

  * the field :guilabel:`Organization` to identify the origin of WAPT packages;

  * the field :guilabel:`Sign waptupgrade with both sha256 and sha1`
    can be ignored because it is only useful when upgrading from version 1.3;

  * the field :guilabel:`Use computer FQDN for UUID`
    and :guilabel:`Use random host UUID (for buggy BIOS)`
    (see explanation in the previous paragraph of this documentation);

  * the field :guilabel:`Enable AD Groups` enables the installation
    of profile packages based on the Active Directory groups
    of which the machine is a member. **This feature can degrade
    the performance of WAPT**;

  * the field :guilabel:`Append host's profiles`
    allows you to define a list of WAPT packages to install obligatorily;

  * the field :guilabel:`Automatic periodic packages audit scheduling`
    defines the frequency at which the WAPT agent checks whether it has
    audits to perform;

  * Windows update section, refer to :ref:`this article on configuring WAPTWUA
    on the WAPT agent <wapt_wua_agent>`;

.. danger::

   * The checkbox **Use Kerberos for the initial registration** must be checked
     **ONLY IF** you have followed the documentation
     on **Configuring the Kerberos authentication**.

   * The checkbox **Verify the WAPT Server HTTPS certificate**must be checked
     **ONLY IF** you have followed the documentation
     on **Activating the verification of the SSL / TLS certificate**.

Once the WAPT agent installer has finished building, a confirmation dialog
pops up indicating that the :program:`waptagent` binary
has been successfully uploaded to https://srvwapt.mydomain.lan/wapt/.

.. note::

  A warning shows up indicating that the GPO hash value should be changed.
  GPOs may be used to deploy the WAPT agent on your Organization's computer.

Updating the WAPT agents
++++++++++++++++++++++++

The ``test-waptupgrade`` package has also been uploaded on the repository.

The ``test-waptupgrade`` package contains the WAPT agent with arguments
specified during the installation of WAPT on your Administrator's computer.

.. note::

  This package is a standard WAPT package designed
  to upgrade WAPT agents on client machines.

Upgrading the WAPT agents using the *xxx-waptupgrade* package
is a two step process:

* first the package copies the new :file:`waptagent.exe` file
  on the client computer and creates a new scheduled task that will run
  :program:`waptagent.exe` with predefined installation flags two minutes
  after the creation of the scheduled task.
  At that point the package itself is installed and the inventory on the server
  shows the package installation as *OK*, with correct version installed,
  but the inventory will still show the old version
  as the agent is not yet updated.

* after two minutes the scheduled task starts and runs :program:`waptagent.exe`.
  :program:`waptagent.exe` shutdowns the local WAPT service,
  upgrades the local WAPT install, and then restarts the service.
  The scheduled task is then automatically removed and the WAPT agent sends back
  its inventory to the WAPT server.
  Now the inventory on the server will show the new version of the agent.

From an administrator point of view, looking at the console
you will see the following steps:

* *xxx-waptupgrade* package starts being installed;

* *xxx-waptupgrade* is installed, the machine is up to date from a package list
  point of view, but the version in the inventory is still the old version
  of the WAPT agent;

* after two minutes the computer connectivity status switches
  to *disconnected* as the WAPT agent is updated;

* after around two minutes the client computer gets back up online
  in the console and updates its inventory and shows the new version;

What can go wrong during the upgrades
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

* the most common issue with the upgrading process is the local antivirus
  blocking the installation (WAPT is a software installer that keeps
  a websocket opened to a central management server, so this behavior may
  be flagged as suspicious by an antivirus, even though this method
  is the basis of end point management...).
  **If you have an issue when deploying the upgrade, please check your antivirus
  console and whitelist the waptagent.exe**. Another option is to re-sign
  the :program:`waptagent.exe` binary if your organization has an internal
  code signing certificate;

* the second most common issue is that for some reason another program
  is locking a :mimetype:`DLL` that ships with WAPT. This can happen
  with poorly designed software installers that pick up the local
  %PATH% variable first and then find WAPTs own openssl or python DLL;

* the third most common issue is a defective Windows install
  that does not run scheduled tasks properly, and yes we have seen this!!

Deploying the WAPT Agent on Linux
=================================

.. versionadded:: 1.8

Starting with WAPT 1.8, a Linux agent is available
for Linux Debian / Linux CentOS.

.. note::

  * the following procedure installs a WAPT agent using Tranquil IT's repositories
    for Debian/CentOS;

  * if you wish to install it manually, you can look
    for your `corresponding version <https://wapt.tranquil.it/wapt/releases/>`_;

  * copy the link of the binary that you need,
    download and install it with dpkg / rpm;

Installing the WAPT agent on Debian
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The most secure and reliable way to install the latest WAPT agent
on Linux Debian is using Tranquil IT's public repository.

* add Tranquil IT's repository in apt repository lists:

.. important::

  **Follow this procedure for getting the right packages
  for the WAPT Enterprise** Edition.
  For WAPT Community Edition please refer to the next block.

  To access WAPT Enterprise ressources, you must use the username
  and password provided by our sales department.

  Replace **user** and **password** in the **deb** parameter
  to access WAPT Enterprise repository.

    .. code-block:: bash

      apt-get update && apt-get upgrade
      apt-get install apt-transport-https lsb-release
      wget -O - https://wapt.tranquil.it/debian/tiswapt-pub.gpg  | apt-key add -
      echo "deb https://user:password@srvwapt-pro.tranquil.it/entreprise/debian/wapt-1.8/ $(lsb_release -c -s) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/wapt.list

    echo "deb https://wapt.tranquil.it/debian/wapt-1.8/ $(lsb_release -c -s) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/wapt.list

* install WAPT agent using apt-get:

.. code-block:: bash

  apt-get update
  apt-get install tis-waptagent

Installing the WAPT agent on CentOS
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The most secure and reliable way to install the latest WAPT agent
on Linux CentOS is using Tranquil IT's public repository.

* add Tranquil IT's repository in yum repository lists:

    Replace **user** and **password** in the **baseurl** parameter
    to access WAPT Enterprise repository.

    .. code-block:: bash

      cat > /etc/yum.repos.d/wapt.repo <<EOF
      [wapt]
      name=WAPT Server Repo
      baseurl=https://user:password@srvwapt-pro.tranquil.it/entreprise/centos7/wapt-1.8/

    baseurl=https://wapt.tranquil.it/centos7/wapt-1.8/
    enabled=1
    gpgcheck=1
    EOF

* install WAPT agent using yum:

  .. code-block:: bash

    yum install tis-waptagent

Creating the agent configuration file
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The requisites for your WAPT agent to work are:

* ``wapt-get.ini`` config file in :file:`/opt/wapt/`;

* a public certificate of the package-signing authority in :file:`/opt/wapt/ssl/`;

You need to create and configure the :file:`wapt-get.ini`
file in :file:`/opt/wapt` (:ref:`wapt-get-ini`).

An example of what it should look like is present further down on this page.
You may use it after changing the parameters to suit your needs.

.. code-block:: bash

  vim /opt/wapt/wapt-get.ini

.. code-block:: ini

  [global]
  repo_url=https://srvwapt.mydomain.lan/wapt
  wapt_server=https://srvwapt.mydomain.lan/
  use_hostpackages=1
  use_kerberos=0
  verify_cert=0

Copying the package-signing certificate
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You need to copy manually, or by script, the public certificate
of your package signing certificate authority.

The certificate should be located on your Windows machine
in :file:`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\wapt\\ssl\\`.

Copy your certificate(s) in :file:`/opt/wapt/ssl`
using :program:`WinSCP` or :program:`rsync`.

Copying the SSL/TLS certificate
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If you already have configured your WAPT server to use correct
:ref:`Nginx SSL/TLS certificates <activating_HTTPS_certificate_verification>`,
you must copy the certificate in your WAPT Linux agent.

The certificate should be located on your Windows machine
in :file:`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\wapt\\ssl\\server\\`.

Copy your certificate(s) in :file:`/opt/wapt/ssl/server/`
using :program:`WinSCP` or :program:`rsync`.

Then, modify in your config file the path to your certificate.

.. code-block:: bash

  vim /opt/wapt/wapt-get.ini

And give absolute path of your cert.

.. code-block:: ini

  verify_cert=/opt/wapt/ssl/server/YOURCERT.crt

.. attention::

  If you are not using SSL/TLS certificates with your WAPT Server,
  you must change it in :file:`/opt/wapt/wapt-get.ini` the following lines to 0:

  .. code-block:: bash

    verify_cert=0

Registering your Linux agent
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* restart the WAPT service:

  .. code-block:: bash

    systemctl restart waptservice.service

* finally, execute the following command to register your Linux host
  with the WAPT server:

  .. code-block:: bash

     wapt-get register
     wapt-get update

Your Linux Agent is now installed and configured
and it will now appear in your WAPT Console with a penguin icon!!

  from :program:`waptserver`;

* display wapt package update status in wapt console;

* possibility to import packages from TIS repository and adding
  them to local repository;

* build system embryo;

* after :program:`waptsetup` customization build in :program:`waptconsole`,

* possibility to push :program:`waptagent` installation on a host
  through MS-RPC (if firewall allows it);

WAPT 1.0 Community (févier 2015)
--------------------------------

The release of that milestone has been announced at `Bruxelles FOSDEM

  website store.wapt.fr;

* windows installer improvements to avoid conflicts during installation
  (open ports check, etc.);

* :program:`builbot` continuous building process;

WAPT 1.1 Community (février 2015)
---------------------------------

* several bugs and anomalies have been corrected on 1.0.0 version
  thanks to feedback from users;

* display of reachability of hosts in the WAPT console;

WAPT 1.3 et 1.5 Community (2016-2017)
-------------------------------------

* integration of the authentication of local service in Windows Active Directory
  or Samba-AD;

* adding of a integrated agent building wizard in the WAPT console;

* role segregation between :term:`Package Developers`
  and :term:`Package Deployers`;

* replacement of :program:`MongoDB` by :program:`PostgreSQL`
  with JSON extension;

* Websockets implementation;

* host identification through a shared secret for workgroup hosts
  that cannot access MSAD or Samba-AD domain;

WAPT 1.5 Enterprise (début 2018)
--------------------------------

The features and functionalities described in the section
are only relevant to the **Enterprise** version of WAPT.

* management by Organisational Units (Machine OU);

* taking into account of the Certificate Authority for signing packages,
  in addition to individual certificates;

* kerberos based SSO authentication of :term:`Administrators`
  in the WAPT console;

WAPT 1.6 (August 2018)
----------------------

* recurring audit function to insure configurations
  are maintained over time (**Enterprise**);

* (tech preview) Windows Update management in WAPT, reproducing
  WSUS functionnalities (**Enterprise**);

* authentication by certificate of the WAPT client when accessing
  a repository or connecting to the WAPT Server (inventory, websockets);

WAPT 1.7
--------

* customizable WAPT reporting integrated
  within the WAPT console (**Enterprise**);

* discrimination between user self-service packages and restricted packages
  that may be installed only by :term:`Administrators` (**Enterprise**);

* global updates according to the package's criticity level (**Enterprise**);

  * immediate upgrade for critical updates;

  * with the user accepting the upgrade if it impacts
    the user's current activities;

* software and configuration management using AD Organizational Units
  (*unit* packages) (**Enterprise**);

WAPT 1.8
--------

* client agent for Linux Debian, Linux CentOS, Ubuntu and Apple MacOS;

* built-in WAPT packages repository replication;

* built-in repository selection rules;


Later
-----

* creation of the :abbr:`GPO (Group Policy Object)`
  for deploying the WAPT agent directly from the WAPT console (**Enterprise**);

* signature of packages and actions, and token based authentication
  on the WAPT console (**Enterprise**);

* integration of inventory in GLPI and other asset management
  tools (**Community** and **Enterprise**);

* asset management from the WAPT console (**Enterprise**);

* kerberos based SSO authentication of the :term:`Users`
  on the :program:`webservice` (**Enterprise**);

* creation of *stub* packages to avoid licensing problems
  for some proprietary software. The :term:`Package Developer` would download
  the package from a trusted public repository, then he would download
  the software binaries from the editor's website to obtain a complete package.
  This will facilitate the creation of packages embedding software
  with restricted distribution rights (**Enterprise**);

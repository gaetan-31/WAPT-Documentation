Replicating a repository to preserve the bandwidth on remote sites
==================================================================

When WAPT is used on bandwidth limited remote sites, it makes sense to have
a local device that will replicate the main WAPT repository to reduce
the network bandwidth consumed when deploying updates on your remote devices.

With remote repositories, WAPT remains a solution with a low operating cost
because you don't have to implement high bandwidth
fiber links to take advantage of WAPT.

    Replicating WAPT repositories

It works as follows:

  * a small form factor and no maintenance appliance with the role
    of secondary repository is deployed on the local network
    of each remote site; a workstation can also be used, although
    it may not be up and running if you want to connect to it;

  * the remote repository replicates the packages from the main repository
    and other repositories;

  * the WAPT clients connect in priority with the repository
    that is the closest to them, the local repository;

.. hint::

  The former method used to sync repositories was Syncthing and that method
  is available both for the Community and the Enterprise versions of WAPT.

  You can find the old documentation here: :ref:`syncthing_usage`.

  **The method explained below is for the Enterprise version only**.

WAPT Agent replication role
---------------------------

.. versionadded:: WAPT 1.8 Enterprise

Starting with WAPT 1.8, repository replication can be enabled using a WAPT agent
installed on an existing machine, a dedicated appliance or Virtual Machine.

The replication role is deployed through a WAPT package that enables
the :program:`Nginx web server` and configures scheduling, packages types,
packages sync, and much more.

This feature allows WAPT agents to find dynamically their closest available
WAPT repository from a list of rules stored on the WAPT server.

Replication behavior
++++++++++++++++++++

Repository replication in WAPT is now handled by WAPT agents natively
(**Enterprise versions only**).

It is based on a :file:`sync.json` file which indexes every files
present in these folders:

* wapt;

* waptwua;

* wapt-host;

Enabling replication has the following effects:

* once ``enable_remote_repo`` is enabled on a WAPT agent, it will sync packages
  locally inside the :file:`local_repo_path` folder;

* it adds the WAPT agent in the :guilabel:`Repositories` tab
  as a Remote repository, enabling new actions such as :guilabel:`Force Sync`
  or :guilabel:`Check files`;

* by default, only the :file:`wapt` folder is synchronized, you can select
  which folder to sync by adding up elements in ``remote_repo_dirs`` parameters;

* synchronization period can be configured with ``local_repo_time_for_sync_start``
  and ``local_repo_time_for_sync_stop`` parameters;

* bandwidth allocated to sync can be configured with ``local_repo_limit_bandwidth``;

Every parameters of WAPT repository sync must be set
in the ``[repo-sync]`` section of the WAPT agent's :file:`wapt-get.ini`
configuration file.

    Replication role behavior

Enabling replication on WAPT Agent
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To enable replication on an existing agent (Linux/Windows) you need to deploy
a WAPT package. It's role is to:

* install and enable the :program:`Nginx web server`;

* configure nginx virtualhost;

* enable remote repository configuration in :file:`wapt-get.ini`;

A ready-to-use WAPT package is available in our public store
to enable repository replication on Windows or Linux WAPT agents:
https://store.wapt.fr/store/tis-remote-repo-conf.

WAPT Agent replication configuration
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

WAPT Agent replication configuration is set in the ``[repo-sync]``
section in the :file:`wapt-get.ini` configuration file of the WAPT agent:

==================================== ======================= =========================== ====================================================================================
Options                              Mandatory               Example value               Definition
==================================== ======================= =========================== ====================================================================================
``enable_remote_repo``               Yes                     ``True``                    Enables remote repository sync connections.

``local_repo_path``                  Yes                     ``/var/www/``               Set local packages root repository path

``local_repo_time_for_sync_start``   No                      ``22:30``                   Set sync start time (HH:MM / 24h format)

``local_repo_time_for_sync_end``     No                      ``05:30``                   Set sync stop time (HH:MM / 24h format)

``local_repo_sync_task_period``      No                      ``25``                      Set sync period (minutes)

``local_repo_limit_bandwidth``       No                      ``2``                       Set sync allowed bandwidth (Mbits/s)

``remote_repo_dirs``                 No                      ``wapt,waptwua,wapt-host``  Set synced folders (default: wapt,waptwua)
==================================== ======================= =========================== ====================================================================================

Below is an example of :file:`wapt-get.ini`:

.. code-block:: ini

  [global]
  ...
  use_repo_rules = True

  [repo-sync]
  enable_remote_repo = True
  local_repo_path = D:\WAPT\
  local_repo_time_for_sync_start = 20:30
  local_repo_time_for_sync_end = 05:30
  local_repo_sync_task_period = 25
  local_repo_limit_bandwidth = 4
  remote_repo_dirs = wapt,waptwua,wapt-host

WAPT Server replication configuration
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The WAPT Server needs to be aware of repositories to sync in the ``[options]``
section of its :file:`waptserver.ini` located in :file:`/opt/wapt/conf/`

==================================== ======================= ======================================================
Options                              Example value           Definition
==================================== ======================= ======================================================
``remote_repo_support``              True                    Enables remote repository sync server side (sync.json)
==================================== ======================= ======================================================

Then we must restart both *waptserver* and *wapttask*:

.. code-block:: bash

  systemctl restart waptserver wapttask


Repository rules
----------------

Repository rules behavior
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

By enabling repository rules support, the WAPT agents will automatically
retrieve their :file:`rules.json` file from the WAPT server.

The :file:`rules.json` file is a signed :mimetype:`.JSON` file
that contains a list of sorted rules to apply to the WAPT agent,
so to redirect its downloads from the most appropriate repository.

If no rules can be matched, WAPT agent fallbacks onto the ``repo_url`` settings
of the WAPT server :file:`wapt-get.ini` configuration file.

    Repository rules behavior

Enabling repository rules
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Repository rules are configured in WAPT Console.

Rules can be based on several parameters:

==================================== =========================== ====================================================================================
Options                              Example value               Definition
==================================== =========================== ====================================================================================
Domain name                          ``ad.domain.lan``           Rule based on Active Directory domain name

Domain sites and services            ``Paris-HQ``                Rule based on Active Directory Sites and Services

Agent IP                             ``192.168.85.0/24``         Rule based on Agent IP sub-network

Public IP                            ``256.89.299.22/32``        Rule based on Public IP (NATed hosts)

Hostname                             ``desktop-04feb1``          Rule based on hostname
==================================== =========================== ====================================================================================


Adding a rule in the WAPT Console
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

In :guilabel:`Repositories`, click on the :guilabel:`Add rule` button. The following window appears:
..figure:: create_new_rule.png
	:align:center


You can then choose from the different above parameters and affect values to a specific secondary WAPT repository.
The option :menuitem:`No Fallback` will prevent from falling back to the main WAPT server and will avoid potential network congestion.


The rules are applied from top to bottom, and the first rule that matches the conditions overrides all the other rules below.



Using repository rules on WAPT agents
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. warning::

  **If you have configured GeoIP redirects on Nginx,
  you should disable it as it might conflicts with repository rules**.

To enable WAPT Agent repository rules, you must enable this setting in the ``[global]``
section of :file:`wapt-get.ini` configuration of the WAPT agent:

==================================== ======================= =========================== ====================================================================================
Options                              Mandatory               Example value               Definition
==================================== ======================= =========================== ====================================================================================
``use_repo_rules``                   No                      ``True``                    Enables repository rules usage
==================================== ======================= =========================== ====================================================================================

Below is an example of :file:`wapt-get.ini`:

.. code-block:: ini

  [global]
  ...
  use_repo_rules = True

  Cybersecurity solutions are many and diverse, but not all of them offer
  the same level of effectiveness, robustness and trust.

  Security Visas that the French cyberdefense agency, ANSSI, delivers allow to
  identify more easily the most reliable security solutions. They are recognized
  as such after having been evaluated by approved laboratories following
  a rigorous and recognized methodology.

Security Certification from French Cyberdefense Agency ANSSI
------------------------------------------------------------

Following its first level security certification obtained on 14 February 2018,
WAPT has been prized with a `higher level certification <https://www.tranquil.it/

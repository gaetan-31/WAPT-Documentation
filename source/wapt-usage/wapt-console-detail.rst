  WAPT console displaying inventory

The WAPT console lists hosts that are registered with the WAPT Server
and some information that is useful for managing the hosts.

Selecting a host displays its information in the right panel of
the WAPT console (:guilabel:`Hardware inventory` and
:guilabel:`Software inventory`).

Hardware inventory displays the hardware inventory of the host
--------------------------------------------------------------

Common informations displayed in the :guilabel:`Hardware inventory` tab is:

* the name of the host;

* the description of the host;

* the operating system running on the host;

* the IP address of the host;

Do a search based on a WAPT package
-----------------------------------

In the :guilabel:`Private repository`, select the package and then
click on :guilabel:`Show Hosts`.

The grid will display the hosts on which the package is installed.
Note that the filter is only active on the :guilabel:`Package` attribute
of the selected package.

The different columns display information about the packages installed
on the machine (e.g. *package version*, *package status*, *audit status*,
*installation date*, *architecture*).

You can also add the columns :guilabel:`Log install`
and :guilabel:`Last Audit Output` to display at a glance the installation
and audit logs.

Creating a group package
------------------------

Group packages allows you to create a package containing other packages
to be affected as a dependency to a host.

To create a group of packages, go to the :guilabel:`Bundles` tab:

.. figure:: wapt_console-package-group-grid.png
  :align: center
  :alt: Package group grid

  Package group grid

* click on :guilabel:`New bundle`;

* give a name to the *group* package;

.. hint::

  If you name a group package with the same name as an Active Directory
  security group (Microsoft or Samba-AD), a member of the Active Directory
  group can be automatically added to the WAPT group package.

* fill in the description, add packages to the group package by dragging
  and dropping them or by Right-clicking on the package name,
  and adding it to the bundle;

.. figure:: wapt_console-add-packages-to-group.png

  :alt: Forbid a package

  Forbid a package

In the :guilabel:`Software Repository` tab, the list of packages currently
available in the WAPT repository appears. By default, the console will only
show the latest version of packages.

To display all package versions, untick :guilabel:`Last version only`.
To delete a package from the repository, :menuselection:`Right-click
--> Remove from repository`.

.. figure:: wapt_console-remove-package-from-repository.png
  :align: center
  :alt: Remove a package

  Remove a package

To edit a package, :menuselection:`Right-click --> Edit package`,
the package will be downloaded locally in **the base package
development directory** set in the console settings.

Make changes to the package as wanted, rebuild the package and upload it back
to the repository. Once your package has uploaded, refresh the package list
using the :guilabel:`Refresh package list` button or by pressing :kbd:`F5`
on your keyboard.

A search bar is also available to filter packages.

.. hint::

	With the :guilabel:`section` drop-down menu, you can choose
  to create a profile package rather than a *group* package.

Cleaning the local cache from the WAPT console
----------------------------------------------

When importing a package from the Internet, the WAPT console downloads the package
in :file:`%appdata%\local\waptconsole\cache` .

To clean the cache and free up disk space, click on :menuselection:`Tools
--> Clean local cache`.

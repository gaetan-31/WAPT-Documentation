Using WAPT SelfService
======================

.. versionadded:: 1.7 Enterprise

Presentation
------------

With WAPT 1.7 **Enterprise** you can now filter the list
of self-service packages available for your users.

Your users will be able to install a selection of WAPT packages
without having to be a :term:`Local Administrator` on their desktop.

The :term:`Users` gain in autonomy while deploying software and configurations
that are trusted and authorized by the :term:`Organization`.
This is a time saving feature for the Organization's IT support Helpdesk.

How does it work?
-----------------

With WAPT 1.7 **Enterprise**, a new type of WAPT package exists beside *base*,
*group*, *host* and *unit* packages: they are **selfservice** packages.

A *selfservice* package may now be deployed on hosts to list the different
self-service rules that apply to the host.

How to use the **selfservice** feature?
---------------------------------------

.. hint::

  The **selfservice** feature is only available with WAPT **Enterprise**.

  In the **Community** version, only Local Administrator and members
  of the *waptselfservice* group can access self-service on the agent.

  In the **Community** version, it is not possible to filter
  the packages made accessible to the user.

In the console go to the tab :guilabel:`Self-service` rules.

You can now create your first *selfservice* rule package.

* give a name to your new *selfservice* package;

* click on :guilabel:`Add` to add an Active Directory group (at the bottom left);

* name the *selfservice* group (with :kbd:`F2` or type directly into the cell);

* drag the allowed software and configuration packages
  for this *selfservice* group into the central column;

* add as many groups as you want in the package;

* save the package and deploy the package on your selection of hosts;

* once the package is deployed, only allowed packages listed
  in the *selfservice* group(s) of which the :term:`User` is a member
  will be shown to the logged in :term:`User`;

.. note::

  * If a group appears in multiple *selfservice* packages, then the rules are merged.
  * The authentication used is system authentication, local users and groups, but if the machine is in a domain then authentication and groups will also work with users and groups in the domain.


How to use the self-service on the user station?
------------------------------------------------

The self-service is accessible to users in the start menu under the name
:guilabel:`Self-Service software WAPT`.

It is also available directly in :file:`<base>\\waptself.exe`.

The login and password to enter when launching the self-service
are the User's credentials (local or Active Directory credentials).

The self-service then displays a list of packages available for installation.

.. figure:: waptself.png
  :align: center
  :alt: Self Service

* the user can have more details on each package with the :guilabel:`+` icon;

* different filters are available for the user on the left side panel;

* the :guilabel:`Update Catalog` button is used to force a
  :command:`wapt-get update` on the WAPT agent;

* the list of package categories is displayed to the user.
  To add a category to the list, you must specify the category
  in the *categories* section of the :file:`control` file
  of the relevant package;

* the current task list of the WAPT agent is available
  with the :guilabel:`task bar` button;

* it is possible to change the language of the interface
  with the :guilabel:`configuration` button at the bottom left.

Customizing the Self Service interface
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Adding the Logo of your Organisation
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

It is possible to change the logo that appears in the self-service interface
and therefore improve the acceptation of the Self Service feature by your users.

To do this, simply place the logo you want in
:file:`<wapt>\\templates\\waptself-logo.png`

.. note::

   It is highly recommended to use a :mimetype:`.png` file with a *200 x 150px*
   resolution.

Managing package categories
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Default categories are:

* Internet;
* Utilities;
* Messaging;
* Security;
* System and network;
* Storage;
* Media;
* Development;
* Office​​;

You can create your own categories easily by filling the :file:`control`
file's ``categories`` section of any WAPT package and write a new category
of your choice, WAPT will automatically show the package in the new category.

WAPT Agent Settings for WAPT Self-Service
-----------------------------------------

WAPT Agent can be configured to force WAPT SelfService packages filtering to local admins :ref:`waptself_ini_file`.

Configure a different authentication for the selfservice
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As mentioned above, authentication on wapt service is configured by default in system mode.

This means that the wapt service transmits the authentication directly to the operating system, it also recovers the groups by directly interrogating the operating system

This behavior is defined with the value of "service_auth_type" in wapt-get.ini. The default value is system

In this mode we assume that local administrators can see all the packages.  To modify this behavior modify the value of "waptservice_admin_filter" in wapt-get.ini See here :ref:`waptself_ini_file`.

Two additional modes are available (since version 1.8.2) :

* waptserver-ldap, This mode allows authentication to the wapt server. The wapt server will make an ldap request to verify authentication and groups.
  Warning ! For this to work, you must have configured LDAP authentication on the Wapt server, (the configuration of the admin group will be ignored)
  See here :ref:`configure_ad_auth`
  
* waptagent-ldap, This mode allows authentication with an ldap server identified in wapt-get.ini. The wapt agent will make an LDAP request to verify authentication and groups. 
  See here :ref:`waptself_ini_file`.
  
.. note::

   For the system authentication under linux to work correctly, be sure to correctly configure your pam authentication and your nsswitch.conf   
   The "id username" command must return the list of user groups
